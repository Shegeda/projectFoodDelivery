# projectFoodDelivery

Hi everybody!
I so glad to see you in my repository :)
This is my pet project for the delivery of healthy food.
Developed in native Java script.
I used a webpack as a module picker.
I also used fetch api to get data into cards from the menu,
and get data from the form.

The project includes:
- modal window
- tabs with animation
- slider
- calorie counting calculator
- menu cards
- timer
